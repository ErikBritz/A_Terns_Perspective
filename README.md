# Animated Arctic Tern Cesium Visualization

This project is a CesiumJS-based visualization of Arctic tern migration built with Vite. It renders a 3D globe, loads migration path data and a tern model from the public assets, and animates movement along the route. The app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with a relative base path and a PowerShell deploy script that publishes the built dist output to the gh-pages branch.
